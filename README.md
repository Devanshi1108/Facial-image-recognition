## Description
Facial emotion recognition is a process that uses artificial intelligence to analyze and identify emotions displayed on a person's face. It is important because facial expressions provide insights into a person's feelings that may not be apparent from verbal communication alone. Deep learning algorithms like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are used to process image data and automatically learn and extract relevant features from facial features. The learned features are then used to classify the person's emotional state. To study the impact of various hyperparameters and models on the accuracy of facial emotion recognition, three datasets were chosen from Kaggle, which had enough classes and images to train the models effectively. MobileNet v2, ShuffleNet v2, and ResNet 18 were the architectures used in the project.
